# HTML-CSS Web Project 🚀

This repository hosts a front-end web project designed to showcase modern and responsive UI development using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. While the project is currently under development, it reflects a strong foundation in web design principles with a focus on structure, layout, and visual appeal.

# Project Overview ✨

This project is built as part of a hands-on learning journey in front-end development. It serves as a demonstration of how to structure semantic HTML and style components using pure CSS — without any frameworks — to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

Though the functionality is still in progress, the visual and structural elements are shaping up to reflect real-world use cases like:

- Landing pages
- Portfolio sections
- Responsive layouts
- Modern UI components

## 🎯 Key Features (In Progress)

- ✅ Clean and semantic HTML structure  
- ✅ Fully responsive layout using media queries  
- ✅ Modular and reusable CSS classes  
- 🔄 Interactive elements (coming soon)  

## 📌 Project Status

🛠️ **Under Development**  
The project is currently a work in progress. The basic layout and design components are being built and refined. Future updates will include interactive features and extended sections.

Stay tuned for more improvements and enhancements!
